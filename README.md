# MATLAB_CameraCalibration_PanoramaToolbox
This repository showcases MATLAB scripts developed for camera calibration and photomosaicing . Utilizing the Oneplus 8 phone, the code demonstrates camera calibration with a checkerboard pattern, achieving reprojection errors as low as [0.023,0.102]. The repository also features a Harris Feature detector script, essential for creating photomosaics and panoramic images. Different datasets, including the Student Center and Latino Student Centre, highlight the algorithm's performance under varying conditions. Users can adjust feature points and overlap percentages for optimal results.
